{"question_id": 7, "text": "Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.\nInput: Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "task": "Self-instruct", "answer": "This paper introduces FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding, and guides slot with explicit intent information and proposes a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing.", "domain_review": "Culture", "domain_labeled": ["Culture"], "total_tokens_step2": 765, "metric_explanation": "4: The response should accurately extract the main points from the abstract without any misinformation. \n5: The response should be concise, summarizing the paper's key findings with only the necessary information.\n12: The response should be well-organized and coherent, making it easy for the reader to understand the summary.\n\n[4, 5, 12]", "num_skills": 3, "metrics": ["Factuality", "Conciseness", "Readability"], "total_tokens": 994, "difficulty_review": "Expert level knowledge", "difficulty_labeled": "expert level knowledge"}

The verdict came after Denard's lawyer argued that his client had been framed for the killing and that the case against him was politically motivated. The trial began on Nov. 20, 1990, with Denard being charged with murder and attempted murder. He was accused of shooting Abdallah as he left a hotel where he was staying. A witness testified that Denard fired at least three shots from an automatic rifle. But prosecutors said there were no witnesses to the incident or any evidence linking Denard to the crime scene. Denard denied involvement in the killing but admitted firing at Abdallah. He also claimed that he was not present when the president was shot. A French judge ruled that Denard could be tried only if he returned to France within 30 days.

The seven juniors were Damon, Leo, Eric, Kristin, Anna, Aaron and Beth. Despite their genders they would all sleep in the same cabin separated by bunks. The juniors cabin was quiet as they all tried to stay warm under the multiple blankets. The seniors however were partying in their cabin telling jokes, scary stories and doing silly things to entertain themselves until the wee hours of the morning. In the teacher\u2019s cabin something rather interesting was happening. Mr. Michaels had brought a six pack of beer and all three of them were getting drunk. In the juniors cabin Leo, who had been cold told his cabin mates that he would head toward the Dinning hall square and take a hot shower. So he left into the night. About twenty minutes later in the Teacher\u2019s cabin Michaels colleague Sophie needed to go. She had to pee, but unfortunately there were no bathrooms in the cabins. So unwillingly she ventured off into the night to find a place to relieve herself. Several minutes later she did and while she was urinating, she felt a gloved hand grab her and she was dragged away into the night. Michael who was in a relationship with Sophia and was madly drunk, he tried to seduce Veronica. Veronica was a few years younger than him and she was married. He tried to kiss her but she backed away. She didn\u2019t feel so well and left into the woods and was sick. She ended up getting lost and was wandering around in circles until she had to pee. She squatted by a snow bank and urinated, but before she could pull her pants up she was grabbed and helplessly pulled away into the night. An hour had passed. Nobody was asleep yet. Michael worried about the girls was afraid to leave the cabin. So he whizzed in the empty beer bottles. Leo had returned half an hour ago and was acting strangely. Kristin however had her period and had used up her last tampon and was embarrassed to ask for one. But she asked the oldest girl Beth, but she laughed at her and refused. Aaron and Damon were teasing her and giving her a hard time about it. Kristin burst into tears and ran away. Leo pissed at the two boys ran after her. It was one of the season worst nights. Black ice filled the forest and it was dead silent. Kristin was cold and lost and was crying. She sat against a tree for several moments before she needed to pee. She urinated and after she had finished she was unwillingly pulled away into the night. Leo however strolled the forest and couldn\u2019t find her. Unluckily he slipped on ice and smashed his head against a tree. He was unconscious in the snow. Meanwhile the Seniors were a having a great time but the juniors were fearful. Two of them had gone missing. Anna had been holding her pee for so long she couldn\u2019t do it anymore. She had been afraid to leave the cabin. So she went to the closest spot she could find and relieved herself. When she had finished she returned to the cabin. Michael had fallen unconscious due to the booze. The remaining juniors decided that the seniors were pulling their legs and went to their cabin. The lights were out and they knocked on the door. Once, twice and three times. No one answered the door. The went to Mr. Michaels cabin but the found him lying on the floor. They knew what they had to do and got over their fears and went into the wood. They searched for what felt like hours, until they came across Leo knocked out. The carried him back to the cabin and wrapped him up in many blankets to warm him up. They found him with his back to the ground but the rest of his jacket was dry in some spots, and wet in others. It was strange but they assumed it was from turning. Thirty minutes passed before he came to his senses. He couldn\u2019t remember anything but seemed okay. He had a huge bruise on his head and didn\u2019t remember anything except leaving for a shower. Although he didn\u2019t remember actually taking a shower. They took notice of how long it took to find one person, they needed help. Damon ran as fats as he could considering the heavy ice. In record time he made it to the square and demanded a search party and a medical team to search the wood. Mr. Michael\u2019s was okay but the students weren\u2019t impressed when they found out that he was drinking. When he regained consciousness he couldn\u2019t remember anything either. They found the seniors in perfect health in their cabin. They searched for hours until the found all of the missing people in a cave near the end of the wood. They had been knocked out and all had hypothermia. They were placed under electric blankets and when they came to their minds were blank but they would all be okay. The trip was ended and they would all be returning in less than an hour. Mr. Michaels apologized for his faults and they were excused. All the girls who went missing all described a lone stalker, but they were the only group of people there. It was one of the students. That one student would be punished. However Damon told the staff that he figured out who he was and that he was innocent. Who was it? How did he know? Who is the stalker?", "task": "Bigbench: minute mysteries qa", "answer": "It was Leo. Damon knew because he went to take a shower but returned in half an hour. Really if he would of taken a shower it would have taken at least an hour before he returned since it was a half an hour walk to go and return. Also the random wet spots were urine. Leo was acting strangely and the reason why he came back short was because he slipped and hit his head on his way to the shower. This made him become a stalker and wanting to harm the girls. When he smashed his head again, he became his old self. He had done it unintentionally.\\n\\nThe came admin offered to pay for his dry cleaning bill and they all had hot chocolate as they awaited the school bus to take them home.
